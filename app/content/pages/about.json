Catching the momentum of economic take-off of China, we were one of the pioneers setting up production in mainland China. We were able to capture the metal business of the manufacturers who moved to China and required metal subcontracting support.\n\n## Frameway Today\n\nFramway Industries have transformed into a group of  companies, namely Frameway Group, with five subsidiaries.
